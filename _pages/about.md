We are an independent research group at TU Darmstadt, Germany, focusing on various areas of Medical Image Computing (MIC) and
Computer-Assisted Interventions (CAI).

Our research focuses include, but are not limited to:

* **Low-resource** AI for resource-constrained clinical environments
* **Continual Learning** to address changes in data distributions
* **Federated Learning** for privacy-preserving medical AI
* Medical image processing and navigation in **Computer Assisted Interventions**
* **Generative Modelling** for surgical images and video


## Teaching

As a research group of the Computer Science department of the Technische Universität Darmstadt we are also involved in teaching and education.
We teach two classes for Master's students in computer science and related fields, which are Deep Learning for Medical Imaging (DLMI) in winter and Deep Generative Models (DGM) in summer.
On a regular basis, we organize specific seminars focusing on several topics related to Machine Learning and Medical Computing.


## Education

We are always interested in motivated students to work in our group on a variety of research topics for fulfilling their Bachelor’s or Master’s thesis.
Please contact Dr. Anirban Mukhopadhyay for more details.
