# Medical and Environmental Computing Lab

MECLab is an independent research group at TU Darmstadt, Germany, focusing on various areas of Medical Image Computing (MIC) and
Computer-Assisted Interventions (CAI).

## Research

We devise Machine learning and Image Acquisition, Analysis strategies for applications in Medicine and Environmental Conservation.
Within Medicine, we focus on both Medical Image Analysis and Computer Assisted Intervention.
Our research in Medical Image Analysis leads to fully automatic strategies for Computer Aided Diagnosis and Segmentation.
For Computer Assisted Intervention, we focus on image-driven surgical planning, surgical process modeling and surgical skill analysis.

## Teaching

As a research group of the Computer Science department of the Technische Universität Darmstadt we are also involved in teaching and education.
On a regular basis, we organize specific seminars focusing on several topics related to Machine Learning and Medical Computing.

## Education

We are always interested in motivated students to work in our group on a variety of research topics for fulfilling their Bachelor’s or Master’s thesis.
Please contact Dr. Anirban Mukhopadhyay for more details.
