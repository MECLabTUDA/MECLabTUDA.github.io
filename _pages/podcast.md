Since 2021, we host a podcast called *AI-ready Healthcare*, featuring deep meaningful discussions for knowledge dissemination and constructive arguments, with a shared mission about making Healthcare AI-ready.
We invite stakeholders such as clinicians, AI experts, industry personnel and regulatory personnel to talk about the translational aspects of AI research into patient care.
AI-ready Healthcare is endorsed by the MICCAI society and is enjoyed by listeners around the globe.
By mid 2024, we recorded more than 75 episodes.
