The Visual Computing Lab (Praktikum Visual Computing, PVC) is an excellent opportunity for students to improve their practical skills and improve their problem-solving abilities in a hands-on project.
The PVC takes place in every semester, with a kick-off meeting taking place in the second week of the lecturing period.
