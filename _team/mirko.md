My PhD is focusing on Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) in medical imaging. Especially creating Top-Down models is the main focus of my work.

Furthermore I'm involved in projects in the field of Federated Learning in Digital Pathology.

If you want to get involved in research projects on these topics, please do not hesitate to email me.
