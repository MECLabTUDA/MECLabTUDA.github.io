My research interests include, but are not limited to:

- Navigation and guidance in endovascular surgery (Electromagnetic Tracking, Digital Subtraction Angiography)

- Deep Learning for medical imaging (mainly classification, detection, segmentation), in particular for capsule endoscopy

- Phantom building, crafting experimental setups and simulations for in-vitro and in-silico studies

Together with my supervisor Anirban Mukhopadhyay, I host the "AI-Ready Healthcare"podcast.

Feel free to reach out to me for Bachelor's and Master's theses, VC Praktika or clinical/industrial collaborations.
