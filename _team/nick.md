In my research I focus on **resource-constrained AI** especially performed with **Neural Cellular Automata (NCA)** in medical image analysis such as MRI/CT segmentation. Also, I work on **Continual Learning**, **Domain Adaptation** and **Domain Generalization** methods for NCAs or other medical image segmentation models such as UNets.
Furthermore, I am interested in **Multimodal learning**, **Natural Language Processing** for medicine and **Federated Learning**
